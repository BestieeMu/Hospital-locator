Project
Project Name: Emergency Response Locator
Project Description: Emergency Response Locator is a web application that allows users to quickly and easily locate emergency services such as hospitals, police stations, and fire stations within their vicinity. The app will use geolocation to determine the user's location and provide a list of nearby emergency services. Users can filter the results based on the type of service they need and get directions to the selected service. The project aims to improve emergency response times by providing quick and easy access to emergency services.

Other potential project ideas:

A social media platform for pet owners
A productivity app for remote workers
A recipe sharing website
Reasons for interest in the Emergency Response Locator project: As a front-end developer with experience in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git, I believe that I have the technical skills required to build a user-friendly and responsive emergency response locator application. Moreover, the project's goal of improving emergency response times and potentially saving lives makes it a highly impactful and meaningful project to work on.

Tentative project architecture or approach: The Emergency Response Locator will require the integration of geolocation services to determine the user's location and display nearby emergency services. The application will also require a database to store information about the emergency services, their locations, and contact information. I plan to use React for the front-end development, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The app will be designed to be mobile-responsive and accessible to a broad range of users.

Expected project plan and timeline with milestones:

Research and planning: 1 week
